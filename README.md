# Show the Local Weather
**Objective:** Build a [CodePen.io](https://codepen.io/) app that is functionally similar to this: http://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/bELRjV.
#### User stories:
  1. I can see the weather in my current location.
  2. I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.
  3.  I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
